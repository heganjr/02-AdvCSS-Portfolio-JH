## The Task
To make myself a potential employee within the full stack web development industry, a portfolio is ideal as a 'Resume' to showcase what I am able to produce with examples of my work through the design of the portfolio webpage it's self and links embedded within the portfolio taking the user to deployed pages of my work

A brief introduction to myself is shown with a navigational bar taking the user to sections of the page.

In addition, there are links directing the user to said above applications and also contact me links.

These contact me image links allow the user to:
-   Take the user to the phone dial where my phone number will be shown to call.
-   Open up a new email within their default mail application to send me a :mailto email.
-   Take the user to my work-related GitHub page allowing them to see my public repositories.

This will be updated throughout the course as my skills improve and I create new and exciting projects
